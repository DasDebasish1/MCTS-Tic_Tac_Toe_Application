Running the Program:-
1. To view tree plotter , 'VISUALIZATION' in the code need to set to True
2. Tree plotter is only available in iteration based. Hence number iteration would be taken as a input from the user when 'VISUALIZATION' is set to True
3. If VISUALIZATION is set to False, the game will work on time based and hence time in seconds will be taken as a input from the user.
